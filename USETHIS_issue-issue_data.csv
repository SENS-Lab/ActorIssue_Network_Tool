Issue A,Issue B,value,Description
Air Quality , Forests,0.4,"Although healthy forest microclimates are generally resilient to air quality issues, instances of particulate matter and sulfates may impact particular plant species. These air pollutants can enter forests if they are downwind of areas with poor air quality."
Air Quality , Green Infra,0.1,"High levels of ground level ozone or particulate matter can affect growth of vegetation in Green Infrastructure, including native plants or trees, and can shorten their life spans."
Air Quality , Habitat Loss,0.4,"Air pollution has the potential to disrupt terrestrial and aquatic habitat by affecting the plant species that are able to survive in a region. Acid rain, although today it is less of an issue, can dramatically reduce aquatic and terrestrial habitat by creating acidic conditions for plants and causing dead zones in lakes."
Air Quality , Human Health,1,"Air quality issues immensely impact human health. Pregnacies can be impacted, where infant brain development and adolescent lung development are impacted. Adult respiratory conditions becomed worsened with air quality impacts, especially affected are those with asthmatic or cardiovascular conditions. Particulate matter and ozone are primary concerns for human health. "
Air Quality , Invasive Species,0.2,"To a minimal degree, air quality may indirectly allow for invasive plants to spread in systems where natives cannot withstand air pollutants."
Air Quality , Land Use,0.45,Air quality factors often time enter into land use decisions. Federal air quality standards may restrict certain land uses. Poor local air quality might restrict development in cases of poor health or odor. 
Air Quality , Nutrients,0.15,"Sulfur dioxides and nitrogen containing compounds in the atmosphere play into the acidity of rain, therefore alter soil acidity. Differential soil acidity can impact phosphorus solubility and nutrient management programs, and in some cases, can contribute to nutrient loss."
Air Quality , Pests and Path,0.35,"Poor air quality can degrade the health of plants or crops, rendering traditional host plant species more susceptible to invasion by invasive pests or pathogens."
Air Quality , Recreation,0.5,"To a degree, air quality issues affect visitation patterns for green spaces. Especially poor air quality can harm the actual vegetation in a green space."
Air Quality , Restoration,0.15,"The air quality benefits that result from restoration projects could be a secondary, not primary, reason to restore a natural system."
Air Quality , Rising Temps,0.65,"Carbon dioxide (greenhouse gas) and ozone lead to warming temperatures, and poor air quality from nitrogen, sulfate, and aerosol pollutants can lead to cooling temperatures if sunlight becomes blocked."
Air Quality , Soil Erosion,0.1,"In extreme cases only, high levels of air pollution can damage plant life, allowing for erosion to occur in areas without root cover."
Air Quality , Storm Water,0,"PM2.5 or PM10 can be deposited or settled into stormwater in extreme scenarios, although this effect is less direct."
Air Quality , Transportation,0.35,"Poor air quality changes the way people go about their daily lives, including the amount they drive, or whether the choose to ride public transit. More importantly, air quality policies can be designed to filter out air pollution from transportation sources, thereby affecting transportation systems and vehicles."
Air Quality , Tree Mgmt,0.25,"Because some species of trees are incompatible with poor air quality, extreme cases of air quality issues can impact urban forests. This is especially true with high ozone levels, as the ozone oxidizes and eats away at tree leaves. Acid rain is no longer much of a threat to vegetation or urban trees. "
Air Quality , Vulnerable Com,0.85,"Vulnerable populations are historically located downwind of pollutants, which is especially true for people of color in urban areas. These air pollutants cause major health issues for vulnerable populations who are disproportionately exposed. What's more - vulnerable populations often times lack the resources to deal with the problem in terms of health care or political clout."
Air Quality , Warm Season,0.25,"Certain GHGs, like ozone and CO2, contribute to the changing climate and changing warm season. Moreover, air quality is an issue that is a major driver of political environmental change and positive legislation, which can indirectly impact GHG emissions."
Air Quality , Water Quality,0.2,"Airborne heavy metals and particulates may settle and deposit in waterways. This is a means by which dangerous heavy metal pollutants enter waterways, although is of lesser importance."
Forests , Air Quality,0.5,"Forests filter out some contaminants from the air as it passes through, resulting in improved air quality in areas immediately around the forest. Forests also capture CO2, acting as a carbon sink."
Forests , Green Infra,0.15,"Forests have little impact on Green Infrastructure, since forests are typically thought to occur in more rural areas, while GI are urban designs. In an indirect way, forests can inspire people to create green (GI) in and around their own neighborhoods."
Forests , Habitat Loss,0.85,Healthy forests provide an immense amount of habitat. The loss o forests from development leads to the loss of habitat and biodiversity. Healthy forests also promote healthy streams and wetlands.
Forests , Human Health,0.85,"Healthy forests can improve the physical and mental health of people who breathe cleaner air due to the forest's filtration capabilities, are less affected by climate change due to the forest acting as a carbon sink, and have improved mental health when they are able to access nature (i.e. nature deficit disorder)."
Forests , Invasive Species,0.7,"A healthy and diverse forest is better able to fend off invasives. Oftentimes, degraded forests and human activities in forests lead to invasive species thriving. Opened canopies from logging is an invitation for certain invasive plants. "
Forests , Land Use,0.45,"The existence of a forested area can alter the valuation and possibilities for adjacent land uses, so as to either take advantage of forest resources, or to restrict infringement upon the forested land. Human-wildlife conflicts lead to altered land-use decision-making."
Forests , Nutrients,0.8,"Healthy forests are an essential component for the absorption of nutrients. Forests play a key role in nutrient cycling, but may not always occur in areas where there is excess nutrient runoff from human activities."
Forests , Pests and Path,0.85,"The type and diversity of a given forest has much to do with its susceptibility to pest and pathogen invasions. An ash forest, for example, is highly susceptible to the Emerald Ash Borer. Weakened trees are generally more susceptible to pests and pathogens."
Forests , Recreation,1,"Forests provide recreational opportunities as a green space, depending on accessibility."
Forests , Restoration,0.65,"In cases of degraded forest health, there is more motivation for restoration projects. The composition of forests has much to do with the appropriate restoration practices that can or should be taken, as well as constraints on restoration."
Forests , Rising Temps,0.55,"Forests have a noticeable effect on microclimate temperatures due to shading. Globally, forest cover constitutes an effective carbon sink that mitigates temperature rise."
Forests , Soil Erosion,0.85,"Through tree roots and vegetative cover, forests are major preventers of soil erosion. Unhealthy forests due to logging or tree lost from pests allow for erosion."
Forests , Storm Water,1,Forested areas slow down and absorb surface water or stormwater as it passes through. The loss of tree canopy in a forest dampens its ability to slow stormwater.
Forests , Transportation,0.3,The presence of forests may restrict transportation planning so as to restrict infringement. Road shading from forests and trees lengthens the lifespan of road pavement.
Forests , Tree Mgmt,0.35,There are several indirect ways in which forests impact urban forests. Forests can provide a habitat corridor for urban forests or can act as a source of invasives.
Forests , Vulnerable Com,0.45,Forests can provide economic opportunities for some vulnerable populations who may choose to exploit forest resources for livelihoods and jobs.
Forests , Warm Season,0.65,"Because forests sequester carbon, they can moderate and lessen the impacts of the warm season climate changes. However, forests have a drastic effect on an area's microclimate."
Forests , Water Quality,0.95,Forests drastically improve the water quality in adjacent streams by providing filtration and restricting the movement of sediment into streams.
Green Infra , Air Quality,0.45,"When GI projects primarily use native plants or prairie plants, there can be a noticeable improvement in local air quality due to carbon sequestration and filtration. Truly, the amount that GI can impact air quality depends on the scale of the GI."
Green Infra , Forests,0.25,GI has little effect on forests as they are often not located near one another. 
Green Infra , Habitat Loss,0.475,"GI directly provides habitat for certain species, but on a small scale. GI also improves aquatic habitat by limiting the pollutants that enter waterways. "
Green Infra , Human Health,0.75,"GI has been shown to improve mental health by allowing people to access nature. GI also can improve community building and social or emotional health. GI also improves water quality in a watershed, improving human health and recreational opportunities."
Green Infra , Invasive Species,0.25,"Other than the removal of invasive plant species on the structure of the GI, the installation and maintenance of GI has little to do with the spread of invasive speices."
Green Infra , Land Use,0.4,"GI can sometimes be a part of land use planning, or can even be necessitated in certain cases. Due to the cost of GI, engineering land uses may become more difficult or more costly."
Green Infra , Nutrients,0.625,"The ability of a GI to filter out nutrients depends largely on the type of GI (e.g. green roof, rain garden, filter strip), and its location relative to high nutrient inputs. Largely, GI is able to uptake nutrients into plant biomass. "
Green Infra , Pests and Path,0.15,"GI can filter out pathogens that are in stormwater. Rain gardens and green roofs improve biodiversity and resilience in urban ecosystems, improving their ability to fend off pests and pathogens."
Green Infra , Recreation,0.775,GI can sometimes be considered a green space and provide  opportunities for people to enjoy nature.
Green Infra , Restoration,0.45,"As an engineered system that often occurs at a small scale, GI can positively promote and influence restoration projects by acting as a ""regional greenway"" that benefits and encourages restoration activities and the restored systems themselves."
Green Infra , Rising Temps,0.225,"Green Infrastructures limit  urban heat island effects posed by rising temperatures, but have little effect on the globabl phenomenenon of temperature rise due to their small scale. "
Green Infra , Soil Erosion,0.8,"Well-designed GI projects effectively slow down and intercept stormwater, reducing the speed that stormwater travels at on land. Slower and less stormwater that runs over a land means less erosion. This effect is limited to areas adjacent or downhill of the GI project."
Green Infra , Storm Water,1,"Although some types of GI have more of an impact on stormwater than do others, a primary purpose for installing GI is to limit stormwater. "
Green Infra , Transportation,0.475,"Green infrastructure has somewhat of an effect on transportation design, as it often occurs along roads or highways. GI can reduce or improve the walkability, bikability, or drivability of a particular street depending on its design and application."
Green Infra , Tree Mgmt,0.675,"Some managers of GI projects consider maintaining an urban tree canopy to be a type of green infrastructure. Therefore, GI projects can result in an improved urban tree canopy. However, some GI projects, such as rain gardens, require street tree removal."
Green Infra , Vulnerable Com,0.35,"Green Infrastructure alleviates flooding and water quality issues in vulnerable communities to a degree. This depends on the extent of the GI project (size) in vulnerable areas, which often times is minimal to none. In cases where GI does exist in vulnerable communities, it can also serve as a place of healing as a connection to nature."
Green Infra , Warm Season,0.4,"Due to its small scale, GI has little effect on the global phenomenon of the changing warm season climate, although it does have some mitigative microclimate effects on cooling and water retention."
Green Infra , Water Quality,0.925,"Green Infrastructure, depending on its size, is generally very beneficial for water quality in adjacent streams because the infrastructure filters out pollutants and slows down stormwater before it enters streams."
Habitat Loss , Air Quality,0.6,"Loss of habitat, including the loss of vegetation, generally leads to worsened air quality because there is lost air filtration and a lost sink for air pollutants."
Habitat Loss , Forests,0.975,The loss of habitat and ultimate infringement upon existing habitat is hugely detrimental for forest health as existing forests become fragmented and become more susceptible to impacts.
Habitat Loss , Green Infra,0.225,"Without some form of nearby habitat, GI projects may be less successful because there might be a dearth of pollinators or beneficial species, in addition to faster and more stormwater that can be more burdensome for the GI structure."
Habitat Loss , Human Health,0.8,"Lost habitat means less access to nature for humans, which can lead to worsened mental health in addition to less opportunities for phyiscal recreation activities like hiking. Lost habitat also generally means worse air quality which can damage the human body. "
Habitat Loss , Invasive Species,1,"Degraded habitat can often times promote invasive species to spread, especially invasive plants. Lost habitat, including open tree canopies, generally promote invasive plant growth in the understory."
Habitat Loss , Land Use,0.375,"Habitat for endangered or listed species will prevent certain types of land uses if they are thought to negatively impact the species. The loss of habitat on a parcel of land may impact the value of the land in one direction or the other, which alters land use possibilities."
Habitat Loss , Nutrients,0.55,"As habitat is lost to development and impervious surfaces, a watershed can be said to be ""lost"" as it becomes more flasky. This flashiness as a result of lost habitat leads to faster and more stormwater runoff, which means that more nutrients are carried into streams."
Habitat Loss , Pests and Path,0.35,A smaller genetic pool of various plant species due to habitat loss and infrigement generally means that the remaining organisms are more susceptible to pest and pathogen outbreaks. 
Habitat Loss , Recreation,1,The loss of habitat directly limits the potential recreation opportunities that people have in green space areas. 
Habitat Loss , Restoration,0.75,"The loss of habitat or degradation of habitats can be a major driver for restoring a natural system. The degree to which a habitat has been ""lost"" can affect its ability to be restored."
Habitat Loss , Rising Temps,0.175,"As habitats are lost, there is less absorption of CO2 (loss of a carbon sink) and less beneficial microclimate cooling effects from shading. "
Habitat Loss , Soil Erosion,0.9,"The loss of habitat leads directly to soil erosion as there is less forest cover or vegetation that prevents erosion. Certainly, the infringement upon habitat (the human activities themselves) can be known to cause erosion, including for example the tillage of prairies."
Habitat Loss , Storm Water,0.8,"Lost habitat leads to flashier stormwater events, as there is less habitat cover to mitigate and absorb stormwater."
Habitat Loss , Transportation,0.35,"Transportation infrastructure, in some cases, might not be built in certain areas where there are efforts to curb habitat loss. "
Habitat Loss , Tree Mgmt,0.55,"When habitat is lost, there may be more of an effort to plant trees in urban areas to compensate. It is especially important to add urban forestry infrastructure to parcels of land where habitat has been lost. "
Habitat Loss , Vulnerable Com,0.65,Vulnerable populations are disproportionately impacted by lost habitat in that they are especially threatened by the loss of provisioning ecosystem services that are destroyed when habitat is lost. The degree to which this occurs depends on how much a vulnerable population relies upon natural systems for their livelihoods or sustenance.
Habitat Loss , Warm Season,0.225,"The conversion of habitat to infrastructure generally means that there is a smaller carbon sink and a larger carbon source, which contributes to the changing warm season."
Habitat Loss , Water Quality,0.85,"A reduction in habitat equates to less vegetation that is useful to slow down water and pollutants that would enter waterways. Water quality also includes the physical quality of the water (e.g. temperature). The loss of habitat adjacent to streams means there is less shading from trees, leading to warmer waterways."
Human Health , Air Quality,0.15,"Responses to human health impacts have resulted in federal legislation to improve air quality. Also, healtheier individuals may choose to bike or walk more, leading to less emissions from vehicles."
Human Health , Forests,0,Healthy people are more likely to access forests.
Human Health , Green Infra,0.025,People who are healthy and have their needs met (i.e. Maslow's hierarchy of needs) are more likely to be able to think about improving their home environment by installing GI.
Human Health , Habitat Loss,0.1,"There is an increasing recognition that access to nature improves human health. Therefore, human health initiatives have the ability to promote healthy habitat."
Human Health , Invasive Species,0,"To a small degree, individuals in poor health are probably less likely to go out and remove invasives."
Human Health , Land Use,0.3,"Ailments to human health collectively changes the lifestyles of individuals, which may have indirect impacts on land use decision-making."
Human Health , Nutrients,0,"To promote human health, people may choose to eat foods that have higher or lower nutrient footprints."
Human Health , Pests and Path,0.1,"Pest and pathogen management is something that is emphasized when it affects human health. Therefore, poor human health leads to pest and pathogen management and control."
Human Health , Recreation,0.725,"Depending on how healthy people are, there may be some differences in perception, usage, and design of green spaces."
Human Health , Restoration,0.15,"To a degree, people in poor health are less likely to worry about restoring natural systems."
Human Health , Rising Temps,0.05,"To a small degree, individuals in poor or good health may have different carbon footprints, affecting rising temperatures."
Human Health , Soil Erosion,0.05,Degrading human health may spur improper soil management strategies that cause erosion.
Human Health , Storm Water,0,Human health issues stemming from water quality may be a reason to alleviate stormwater issues.
Human Health , Transportation,0.45,"Healthy and unhealthy individuals utilize transportation in different ways in terms of access, frequency, and type of transportation method."
Human Health , Tree Mgmt,0.05,"To an extent, citizens concerned about their health may be proponents of urban forests."
Human Health , Vulnerable Com,0.5,People who are healthy are better able to understand their own vulnerabilities and are primed to improve the situation for vulnerable populations.
Human Health , Warm Season,0.15,People who are healthy have a greater ability to lower their emissions.
Human Health , Water Quality,0.05,People in poor health may have less ability to lessen their impact on water quality and may use products that harm water quality.
Invasive Species , Air Quality,0.05,"Should invasive species wipe out native populations of plant species, there could be less air pollution filtration."
Invasive Species , Forests,1,Invasive species majorly impact forest health and composition by overwhelming and outcompeting native species and reducing habitat quality for other species. Invasives have an easier time taking hold in forests that are already unhealthy.
Invasive Species , Green Infra,0.4,"Invasive plant species can make their way into GI projects, although GI is maintained regularly to minimize the risk of invasives."
Invasive Species , Habitat Loss,1,"Invasive species, especially invasive plants and pests, directly contribute to the loss of biodiversity and habitat, including a decline in habitat quality. The fruit that comes from invasive plants, for example, offers lower nutritional value for organisms than would native flowering plants."
Invasive Species , Human Health,0.45,"Indirectly, as invasive species degrade and destroy habitat, so too are the provisioning services once provided by the habitat."
Invasive Species , Land Use,0.5,The threat of invasive species can be a part of land use planning or not - resulting in invasives being neutralized or simply ignored by various types of land uses.
Invasive Species , Nutrients,0.55,Invasive plants have the ability to uptake nutrients that are in the soil. Invasives that cause the death of native plants lead to the release of nutrients back into the soil/watershed following massive die-offs.
Invasive Species , Pests and Path,0.925,"As the host species changes (i.e. as invasive plants alter community composition in an ecosystem), the composition of pests and pathogens also changes. Pests are oftentimes invasive themselves."
Invasive Species , Recreation,1,"Invasives have the ability to turn green spaces into monocultures. Invasives, therefore, are important to be managed in recreational areas. Invasives impact nature experiences and can affect the quality of recreational opportunities, including fishing and wildflower recreating."
Invasive Species , Restoration,0.95,"Invasive species are often times a driver for restoration initiatives when people ask the question: ""How do I keep the invasives out?"""
Invasive Species , Rising Temps,0,"Invasive species in general have little effect on rising temperatures. If invasive pests, like the Emerald Ash Borer, manage to devastate entire stands of trees, it can cause a carbon sink to turn into a carbon source."
Invasive Species , Soil Erosion,0.5,"Depending on the type of invasive species, certain invasive plants can reduce erosion via their roots, while other invasive plants have a worse grip on the soil than do the native plant species. Furthermore, invasive pests that kill native plants lead to erosion from a loss of vegetative cover."
Invasive Species , Storm Water,0.75,"While some invasive vegetation has filtration and absorption capabilities, the majority of invasive plants are less adept at stormwater mitigation than are native plant species. "
Invasive Species , Transportation,0.325,"The threat of invasives does alter transportation systems in certain ways. A primary effect is that boats, cars, and trains, may need to be inspected for invasive seeds or larvae before taking off. "
Invasive Species , Tree Mgmt,0.9,Invasive plants and pests have the potential to outcompete and degrade trees planted in urban forests.
Invasive Species , Vulnerable Com,0.25,"Although invasive species generally degrade habitat quality, they can sometimes provide nature access for vulnerable populations."
Invasive Species , Warm Season,0.2,Tree and vegetation loss from invasive pressures leads to the loss of a carbon sink.
Invasive Species , Water Quality,0.5,"By and large, invasive plants, fish, and pests have myriad effects on water quality. Invasive zebra mussels improve watr quality. Certain invasive plants are better or worse at stormwater filtration, which impacts water quality. "
Land Use , Air Quality,0.6,"Development, especially industrial development, has well-documented adverse effects on air quality from the release of pollutants. Furthermore, suburban sprawl and highways factor into poor air quality."
Land Use , Forests,0.95,Land uses develop into forests and destroy them and can cause fragmentation of forests. Land uses alter forest hydrology and nutrient flow into the forest. Fragmentation is one of the biggest threats to forest health.
Land Use , Green Infra,0.5,"Impervious surfaces resulting from land use development is often times what makes installing GI especially important to control stormwater. The density or type of land use may create opportunity for, or restrict, GI projects."
Land Use , Habitat Loss,0.925,Land use directly contributes to habitat loss as development infringes upon undeveloped habitat areas. 
Land Use , Human Health,0.8,"Anything done to the land and put into a landspace will invariable affect the livelihoods of the people who live there, including the air they breathe and the water they drink. "
Land Use , Invasive Species,0.85,Poorly managed land uses allow for invasive species to take hold as native habitat is opened up or encroached upon by humans.
Land Use , Nutrients,0.7,Agricultural land uses have major impacts on nutrients by inputting them into watersheds. Nutrient management plans are a part of land use planning.
Land Use , Pests and Path,0.6,"The more a landscape is developed and degraded, the less resilient it is to pest/pathogen invasions, largely because land use lowers plant diversity."
Land Use , Recreation,0.8,"Depending on the land use type, it can prompt integrated or disintegrated green space areas by creating opportunities for recreational spaces. "
Land Use , Restoration,0.65,Land use legacies impact restoration possibilities by changing the landscape and valuation of the land. These changes to the landscape can either make restoration more difficult or even more of a necessitiy.
Land Use , Rising Temps,0.5,"A substantial amount of carbon emissions come from land use change. Increased impervious surface cover and less vegetation leads to more heat reflection and less shading. Overall, these impacts lead to the global phenomenon of rising temperatures and lead to warmer microclimates, including the urban heat island effect."
Land Use , Soil Erosion,0.9,Anytime soil is disturbed or moved from land use it is opened up to being eroded. All land uses lead to erosion of some sort.
Land Use , Storm Water,0.95,"Land use directly changes landscapes and the hydrology of a watershed. Invariable, these changes to the landscape will impact the way in which stormwater travels over the land. Stormwater will become flashier and faster."
Land Use , Transportation,0.9,Land uses necessitate transportation for access. Existing land uses dictate where and how transportation infrastructure is planned and implemented. 
Land Use , Tree Mgmt,0.8,Urban developers include arborists in the planning process in order to establish an ubran tree canopy.
Land Use , Vulnerable Com,0.8,"Gentrification as a modern-day land use technique directly impacts the health and food security of the most vulnerable populations, who are disproportionately minorities that live in congested areas that lack access to certain commodities."
Land Use , Warm Season,0.45,"Urban land uses have negative microclimate effects mostly, but do contribute to the changing climate globally due to concentrated emissions."
Land Use , Water Quality,0.95,"Land use has a major impact on water qualtiy, whether it is from agriculture, industry, urban, or residential development. In all types of land uses, pollutants and eroded soil is likely to enter and pollute waterways."
Nutrients , Air Quality,0.1,"Organic nutrients and the transformation of nitrogen compounds into nitrous oxides can be a way in which nutrient applications impact air quality, although this occurs to a lesser extent."
Nutrients , Forests,0.1,"Nutrients are not usually applied to forest ecosystems, although it is certainly true that nutrients must be available to forest plants for growth. "
Nutrients , Green Infra,0.55,"Nutrients indeed have the ability to impact GI projects, mostly in a positive way. Nutrients help GI projects to grow and flourish, but in excess they can dampen the effectiveness of the GI."
Nutrients , Habitat Loss,0.5,"Because nutrients are an essential part of the growth dynamics of streams or forests, they have much to do with habitat health. Nutrients are especially harmful for aquatic habitat due to toxicity (e.g. HABs). "
Nutrients , Human Health,0.8,Nutrients in foods are important for human nutrition and health. Nutrients in excess in waterways can harm drinking water quality. 
Nutrients , Invasive Species,0.5,Nutrients can be used to by invasive plants to fuel their growth. Certain invasive species are adaptable to changing conditions posed by nutrient influxes.
Nutrients , Land Use,0.5,"Nutrient availability has a major impact on agricultural possibilities, but has less impact on urban land uses."
Nutrients , Pests and Path,0.425,"Because nutrient cycling is critical for plant health, and plant health is critical in plant ability to defend against pests and pathogens, nutrient levels have an indirect impact on pest and pathogen invasions."
Nutrients , Recreation,0.775,"Nutrients (fertilizers) can be applied to green spaces to promote healthy vegetation. In excess, nutrients can worsen water quality in recreational areas, which worsens the green space."
Nutrients , Restoration,0.6,"Nutrient issues may be a reason to deploy restoration projects, including wetland and prairies. Furthermore, nutrients that enter restoration sites drive the rate of succession in the restored site and can therefore enhance or worsen the resilience of the site."
Nutrients , Rising Temps,0.1,"Indirectly, nutrients encourage plant growth and plant growth helps to sequester carbon."
Nutrients , Soil Erosion,0.75,Adequate nutrients are required for plant growth which is what stabilizes soil erosion. 
Nutrients , Storm Water,0.55,"Regions with nutrient issues might require altered stormwater management plans. Nutrients themselves though have only a minor impact on stormwater, in that nutrients encourage plant growth which slows surface runoff."
Nutrients , Transportation,0.15,"In extreme cases, nutrients can hamper aquatic transportation in cases of HABs."
Nutrients , Tree Mgmt,0.4,Trees normally do not require fertilization unless they live in poor soils.  
Nutrients , Vulnerable Com,0.75,"Vulnerable populations who have degraded infrastructure and poor wastewater treatment centers are highly susceptible to nutrient-related water quality problems. Additionally, nutrient-rich foods are less available to vulnerable populations, who rely more heavily on processed foods."
Nutrients , Warm Season,0.2,"Because nutrients encourage plant growth, they are useful in the sequestration of carbon to an extent."
Nutrients , Water Quality,1,"Nutrients have an outstanding impact on water quality as they directly play into aquatic ecological conditions, cause harmful algal blooms, and eutrophy water bodies."
Pests and Path , Air Quality,0.2,Pests and pathogens that wipe out tree canopies have the potential to *indirectly* negatively influence air quality through a loss of filtration/sequestration.
Pests and Path , Forests,1,"Invasive pests and pathogens majorly impact forests in that they can cause massive dieoffs and tree mortality, creating unhealthy forests."
Pests and Path , Green Infra,0.15,"Pests and pathogens alter plant selection for GI projects, where susceptible plants are avoided."
Pests and Path , Habitat Loss,0.85,"Invasive pests and pathogens cause habitat loss as forest health is degraded and trees are killed. The loss of a tree canopy worsens the habitat quality for native species like insects, amphibians, and other plants."
Pests and Path , Human Health,0.9,"There are direct and indirect impacts that pests and pathogens have on human health. Of course, pathogens that are human-transmitted have major impacts on human health. Tics that carry Lyme Disease are increasingly threatining to human health. Tree loss and ecosystem degradation due to pests and pathogens threatens physical health (poorer air quality) and mental health (worsened access to nature)."
Pests and Path , Invasive Species,0.6,"Pests and pathogens can either be endemic to an area, or invasive. Those that are invasive are the ones that are dangerous to a system. Invasive pests and pathogens that change a microenvironment due to tree loss might open up space for invasive plants to come in. Some pathogens actually keep invasive organism populations in check."
Pests and Path , Land Use,0.4,Landscaping and agriculture are the two main types of land uses that are majorly impacted by pests and pathogens. Pest and pathogen management plans are often implemented; some agricultural sites may be abandoned due to pest pressure.
Pests and Path , Nutrients,0.33,"Pests and pathogens can impact nutrients in two main ways. First, insect pests that defoliate trees convert plant biomass into available nutrients, which can run out of an ecosystem. Second, pests that decimate tree populations allow for increased runoff speed and increased soil erosion, which facilitates nutrient runoff."
Pests and Path , Recreation,0.9,"Pests and pathogens pose major problems for green space managers, as they negatively impact green spaces by killing vegetation. If large components of a green space are compromised, then the green space is much less enjoyable for recreation."
Pests and Path , Restoration,0.6,"Often times, the presence of invasive pests and pathogens might be a driver to restore a system back to its natural function and remove the pressure. Pests and pathogens  pose a threat to the restoration process itself, though, by slowing down progress and introducing an additional layer of complexity to the project."
Pests and Path , Rising Temps,0.35,The reduction of greenery from pests and pathogens leads to a pulse of carbon being released into the atmosphere and the loss of a carbon sink. There is also the loss of microclimate shading benefits from the trees that are killed by pests and pathogens.
Pests and Path , Soil Erosion,0.325,"Indirectly, as pests and pathogens weaken or kill vegetation, erosion rates are enhanced as a lower canopy cover allows more rainfall to reach the ground and less plant roots to stabilize the soil."
Pests and Path , Storm Water,0.275,Tree loss from pest and pathogen pressure means poor stormwater control and absrobtion.
Pests and Path , Transportation,0.25,"Pests and pathogens will only impact the transportation system if measures are taken to limit the spread of the pest or pathogen. Examples of human measures include reducing travel overall (COVID-19), inspections of vehicles for invasive pests."
Pests and Path , Tree Mgmt,1,Pest and pathogen problems have dramatic effects on urban foretry especially because they are often less biodiverse (more susceptible to invasion) than are natural systems.
Pests and Path , Vulnerable Com,0.7,Vulnerable commumnities who are already stressed are disproportionately impacted by pest and pathogens. This is because they have fewer resources to fight against pest and pathogen pressures and poor access to health care in cases of disease transmission.
Pests and Path , Warm Season,0,Lost greenery due to pest and pathogen pressure has a small impact on the global phenomenon of the changing warm season climate.
Pests and Path , Water Quality,0.8,"Biological invasions impact the biological quality of the water. Tree loss due to pests and pathogens increases runoff issues, increasing the amount of pollutants that enter into waterways and damage chemical water quality. Tree mortality also alters water temperature from the loss of shading in riparian areas, which affects the physical quality of water."
Recreation , Air Quality,0.75,Green spae areas generally improve air quality due to the filtration abilities of the vegetation.
Recreation , Forests,1,"Green space areas can act as a habitat cooridor and provide remedies to forest fragmentation. Green spaces improve public awareness and education about forests, which can go a long way in forest protection."
Recreation , Green Infra,0.225,Green space use by people may impact Green infrastructure if It becomes misused or damaged.
Recreation , Habitat Loss,0.9,Green space areas provide habitat for many species. Access and visitation of green spaces can increase advocacy for habitat improvements. 
Recreation , Human Health,0.85,Green space access greatly improves physical and mental health for people who use it. It also can improve community building when people come together to green spaces. 
Recreation , Invasive Species,0.925,"Green space management typically involves invasive species removal. Conversely, the use of green space areas by visitors might facilitate the spread of invasive plants or insects by way of ""hitchhiking""."
Recreation , Land Use,0.725,"Land near green spaces may become more valuable and attractive. Green space areas have impacts on land use possibilities, as they are less likely to be converted to development."
Recreation , Nutrients,0.5,"Green space areas have the ability to filter nutrient runoff, but the degree to which this actually has a noticeable impact depends on whether the green space is located downhill of nutrient input sites. Green space managers can purchase abandoned agricultural fields to convert them into green spaces."

Rising Temps , Pests and Path,0.85,"Rising temperatures change the range at which pests and pathogens can thrive in addition to altering the growth rate of host species for pests and pathogens. Increasing temperatures importantly can allow for pests and pathogens to survive over the winter, allowing them to spread farther. Also, pests and pathogens have more life cycles per year in warmer conditions, allowing them to spread farther."
Rising Temps , Recreation,0.45,Rising temperatures may impact green space species composition and phenology in addition to affecting seasonal use patterns.
Rising Temps , Restoration,0.3,"Rising temperatures cause phenological mismatches in restoration sites, affecting the viability of restored vegetation. Erratic temperature swings are especially detrimental for restoration initiatives."
Rising Temps , Soil Erosion,0.3,"Hot and dry soils from rising temperatures and extreme high temperatures create favorable conditions for soil erosion. Hotter soils must be irrigated, more irrigation leads to erosion. "

Rising Temps , Water Quality,0.55,"Because rising temperatures impact the hydrologic cycle, they can lead to greater amounts of precipitation that carry pollutants into waterways, ultimately degrading water quality. Also, warmer ambient temperatures increase water temperatures."
Soil Erosion , Air Quality,0.725,Erosion of soil can influence the amount of particulate matter in the air. 
Soil Erosion , Forests,0.7,Soil erosion can significantly impact forest health as tree growth is hampered and there can be less germination of desirable species. Agricultural erosion may force farmers to log and clear their forested land to convert it to new agricultural land.
Soil Erosion , Green Infra,0.65,Soil erosion can clog GI projects if too much enters the structure. This ultimately reduces the effectiveness of the GI.
Soil Erosion , Habitat Loss,0.75,"Soil erosion leads to habitat loss as vegetation becomes less likely. Sedimentation in rivers cvan harm aqutic habitat, including areas where fish are more likely to spawn."
Soil Erosion , Human Health,0.65,"Soil erosion can threaten food supply, which ultimately impact human nutrition. Eroded soils carry nutrients into water bodies, causing harmful algal blooms that can be toxic to humans."
Soil Erosion , Invasive Species,0.8,Degraded plant health due to eroded soils increases plant susceptibility to invasions. Exposed soil is available to invasive seeds. Some plants planted for soil erosion control are invasive themselves.
Soil Erosion , Land Use,0.7,"Soil erosion is something that is mandated to be considered during land use or transportation projects, especially when the project occurs near waterways. "
Soil Erosion , Nutrients,0.925,"As soils become eroded, they take nutrients along with them. Areas with eroded soils have altered nutrient management plans. "

Soil Erosion , Transportation,0.525,"Soil washouts and clogged up waterways can impact roadways, making it harder to travel on some roads."
Soil Erosion , Tree Mgmt,0.55,Soil erosion can make it difficult to establish trees in urban areas. Trees can be undercut from erosion. 
Soil Erosion , Vulnerable Com,0.75,"Soil erosion can affect food production systems, which  affect vulnerable populations moreso than others from a nutritional standpoint."
Soil Erosion , Warm Season,0.2375,"Loss of soil productivity due to erosion will hinder plant growth, leading to a smaller and closing carbon sink. "
Soil Erosion , Water Quality,1,"Soil erosion increased turbidity and nutrient loading in waterways, which dramatically impacts water quality. Eoded soil is the number one pollutant in waterways. "
Storm Water , Air Quality,0.05,Stormwater runoff that takes down trees and floods homes can lead to worse air filtration or even indoor air quality issues from molding.
Storm Water , Forests,0.4,"Stormwater is usually well-handled by healthy forests, despite some blowdown of trees from the most intense stormwater."
Storm Water , Green Infra,0.8,"Stormwater issues are the main reason why GI is installed. Stormwater can carry sediment and pollutants in the GI structures, creating maintenance requirements for the GI. "

Storm Water , Land Use,0.7,"Stormwater regimes impact the viability of a land for certain land use types. Stormwater management is essential for land use planning, also making it more expensive."
Storm Water , Nutrients,0.85,"Stormwater has a major impact on nutrients as runoff carries nutrients along with it. On ag fields, nutrient loss has more to do with rainfall falling on soils than with stormwater passing through the agricultural site."
Storm Water , Pests and Path,0.35,Stormwater can spread pests and water-borne pathogens. Stormwater that degrades tree health renders vegetation more susceptible to pest and pathogen invasions.
Storm Water , Recreation,0.85,"Green space accessibility and use is worsened by stormwater and flooding as trails can become closed, and streams can become too flashy for kayaking."
Storm Water , Restoration,0.65,"Stormwater issues, in addition to being a reason why an area might undergo a restoration process, can make the act of restoration much more difficult. "
Storm Water , Rising Temps,0,"To a small degree, stormwater issues can result in hydric soils that mediate local temperatures."
Storm Water , Soil Erosion,1,Stormwater directly causes soil erosion and increases the rate at which soil is eroded. 
Storm Water , Transportation,0.725,Flooding and stormwater issues can make roads impassable and disrupt supply chains. Transportation systems are not resilient and are slow to adapt to these changes.
Storm Water , Tree Mgmt,0.75,Flooding kills many trees. Stormwater issues might catalyze urban tree plantings as a means by which to control stormwater.
Storm Water , Vulnerable Com,0.8,"Underserved vulnerable communities are more likely to be located on flood planes, therefore are more likely to experience flooding from excess stormwater. They are also more likely to experience negative consequences from combined sewer overflows."

Transportation , Tree Mgmt,0.7,"Transportation infrastructure often times requires tree removal, depleting a tree canopy. "
Transportation , Vulnerable Com,0.75,Transportation (in)access impacts vulnerable communities who lack resources for their own vehicles. It is more difficult for these communtiies to get around to acquire the resources they need for a healthy lifestyle.
Transportation , Warm Season,0.65,Emissions that come from transportation lead to the intensification of changing warm season climate effect.
Transportation , Water Quality,0.6,"Transportation systems, especially those near waterways, are often times sources of pollutants that enter waterways. The salting of roads for snow and ice removal during the winter season causes major water quality issues (high salinity)."
Tree Mgmt , Air Quality,0.6,"Trees in urban areas filter air pollutants, especially particulate matter. Pine trees emit VOCs (volatile organic carbon compounds) which can be a precursor to ozone problems."
Tree Mgmt , Forests,0.55,Urban forests create habitat corridors that improve forest functions. Urban forests might also facilitate the spread of invasives or diseases. 
Tree Mgmt , Green Infra,0.875,"In some instances, trees can be used as a green infrastructure. The urban tree canopy intercepts and slows down stormwater."

Tree Mgmt , Human Health,0.95,"Urban trees improve physical and mental health by cleaning the air, cooling an area, and offering green spaces for people to access."
Tree Mgmt , Invasive Species,1,"Urban forests can create habitat for invasives to work their way into. Urban forestry sometimes involves actually planting invasive species as urban plants, which often time come from plant nurseries. Sometimes, urban forestry involves invasive species management and removal. "
Tree Mgmt , Land Use,0.6,Urban forests improve the value of urban lands through heat reduction and greenery. The provision of urban trees may be included in land use decision making. 
Tree Mgmt , Nutrients,0.35,"While urban trees and forests do uptake nutrients, they have only a small importance due to the fact that they do not occur near areas with high nutrient runoff. "
Tree Mgmt , Pests and Path,0.9,"Urban trees are typically planted in stressful conditions which makes them more susceptible to pest and pathogens. Therefore, urban forests can serve as resevoirs or bridges for invasions."
Tree Mgmt , Recreation,1,Urban forests provide green spaces. The presence of urban trees (or lack thereof) may make residents more likely to support tax levies that go towards green space preservation.
Tree Mgmt , Restoration,0.75,"Urban forests can sometimes be used for minor restoration efforts, especially in riparian zones. "
Tree Mgmt , Rising Temps,0.5,"Urban forests mitigate rising temperatures at a local level (mitigation of the urban heat island effect), but have little impact on  global temperature rise."

Tree Mgmt , Vulnerable Com,0.775,"Urban trees have been shown to improve oxygen and provisioning ecosystem services for the communities that (are able to) buy into tree management services. Vulnerable populations who lack financial resources might have less canopy cover in their communities, leading to worsened environmental health."
Tree Mgmt , Warm Season,0.6,"Urban trees intercept precipitation and can therefore mitigate the impacts of the changing warm season climate, although urban trees have less to do with global climate change mitigation. Urban trees can decrease the albedo of a land surface and create a cooling effect, in addition to having a noticable impact on humidity and temperatures."
Tree Mgmt , Water Quality,0.85,"Because trees can be used for stormwater management practices, they have beneficial impacts on water quality by holding in sediment and slowing or intercepting pollutants."
Vulnerable Com , Air Quality,0.25,"Vilnerable populations are more likely to contribute to worsened air quality problems because they lack the resources to avoid it. For example, members of vulnerable communities might be more likely to burn their trash, use wood-burning stoves, or drive gas-guzzling cars."
Vulnerable Com , Forests,0.45,Rural vulnerable populations who extract forest resources may mismanage forests and degrade forest health.
Vulnerable Com , Green Infra,0.15,Green infrastructure is difficult to implement in vulnerable communities because they are low income neighborhoods that are less concerned with installing environmentally-beneficial structures than they are with meeting their paychecks.
Vulnerable Com , Habitat Loss,0.25,Vulnerable rural populations who rely on forest resources for their livelihoods have the potential to destroy habitat in the process.
Vulnerable Com , Human Health,0.9,"By being in a Vulnerable population, a person is disproportionately exposed to environmental hazards and is less likely to be able to access proper medical care in these instances. Marginalized communities therefore bear the burden of climate and environmental health impacts."
Vulnerable Com , Invasive Species,0.3,"The lack of resources and time for the management of invasive species in vulnerable communities leads to their persistence, especially near abandoned sites and railways."
Vulnerable Com , Land Use,0.225,"Resource-poor vulnerable communities lack control (a voice) in land use planning. The existence of a vulnerable community in an area may alter development planning (to move away from it), or can require land use planning to consider the vulnerable population by, for instance, implementing public transportation options."
Vulnerable Com , Nutrients,0.5,Vulnerable populations may lack the ability to treat excess nutrients because they could lack wastewater treatment plants. Farmers who are considered to be vulnerable populations utilize nutrient applications for crop production.

Vulnerable Com , Rising Temps,0.15,Vulnerable populations tend to have less of an impact on climate change than do the wealthiest communities because they do not have enoigh resources to have a big effect/carbon footprint.
Vulnerable Com , Soil Erosion,0.4,"An immense need for resources and food can burden the food system and food production on agricultural land, this demand and overuse can lead to erosion in food systems."
Vulnerable Com , Storm Water,0.45,"Although stormwater invariably runs throguh vulnerable areas, these populations lack the resources to control or implement stormwater control methods. Therefore, they contribute to flashy stormwater runoff."
Vulnerable Com , Transportation,0.5,"Resource-poor vulnerable populations lack the ability to control transportation management decisions, in addition to creating a massive demand for public transit options. "
Vulnerable Com , Tree Mgmt,0.525,"In urban vulnerable communities, tree management is not a priority. Therefore, there are typically either less trees or unhealthier trees in impoverished communities compared to wealthy communities."
Vulnerable Com , Warm Season,0.1,"Vulnerable poulations have somewhat of an impact on the shifting warm season climate as they contribute to emissions from using outdated equipment and vehicles. As vulnerable populations become less vulnerable and grow stronger, they have the option to start anew and buy into renewable energy sources."
Vulnerable Com , Water Quality,0.5,Shoddy infrastructure in vulnerable areas leads to higher levels of water pollution. High population density and congestion in urban vulnerable communities causes water pollution. The usage of antibiotic and prescription drugs in vulnerable communities enters waterways and affects chemical water quality.
Warm Season , Air Quality,0.7,"Increased humidity and daytime temperatures can exacerbate ground-level ozone formation. Precipitation is a strong control over air pollution, therefore the changing warm season climate changes the seasonality of air pollutants."
Warm Season , Forests,0.85,"The changing warm season climate impacts forest species composition, as some native species are highly susceptible to climatic changes. This is a slow, gradual change. Warmer wet seasons can cause some species to flourish, and others to falter. The changing growing season increases invasive species pressures, in addition to increased pest and pathogen pressures. "
Warm Season , Green Infra,0.775,"The changing warm season climate and precipitation patterns can spark an increased reliance on GI as an adaptation option. Changes to seasonality can impact the functionality of existing GI designs, potentially by affecting the native plants used for the GI."
Warm Season , Habitat Loss,0.85,"The warm season climate changes cause phenological mismatches and changing patterns. Changing clamtic conditions changes the ways in which habitats function. Increased pest, pathogen, and invasive pressures due to a shifting climate leads to the loss of suitable habitat for native species. "
Warm Season , Human Health,1,"The changing warm season climate exacerbates ground-level ozone, which increases cardiovascular problems for people. Flooding events are more likely, which can harm human health and livelihoods. An increase in allergens, diseases, and pests due to a changing climate can lead to problems for human health. Growing season changes have the potential to disrupt food systems, jeopardizing human nutrition."
Warm Season , Invasive Species,0.875,"The changing warm season climatic patterns creates conditions conducive for the spread and success of invasives in new regions. Although invasives largely enter a new region due to human movement, they are increasingly surviving and thriving due to more suitable and warmer environments. "
Warm Season , Land Use,0.7,"New precipitation and seasonality regimes definitely impact land use planning, as land use planners must build infrastructure that can be resilient to precipitation and temperature extremes. The changign warm season climate has a major impact on the viability of some agricultural land uses."
Warm Season , Nutrients,0.875,Changing daytime and nighttime temperatures impact the uptake of nutrients by plants. High intensity precipitation events lead to nutrient loss on agricultural sites. These changing conditions affect the timing and amount of nutrient applications that are necessary.
Warm Season , Pests and Path,0.95,"The warming of the warm season and warming of overnight low temperatures allows for the fuerther expanmsion of pests. More water vapor in the atmosphere creates more rainfall, which leads to pathogen spread. Tropical diseases are able to penetrate further North. Warming winters reduces the amount of winter kill of pests. Longer growing seasons allows for pests to have more life cycles in a year. All of these effects lead to heightened pest and pathogen pressures."
Warm Season , Recreation,0.85,"A longer and warmer warm season means that people will seek out more recreation opportunities. Extreme heat can limit recreation. Water quality issues caused by warm season changes can keep people away. The changing warm season alters the growing season, species composition, and phenological patterns of the green space itself."
Warm Season , Restoration,0.575,Increases in precipitation extremes can make restoration much more difficult. Droughts after seedings can wreck resoration efforts.

Warm Season , Transportation,0.65,"The changing warm season climate impacts transportation infrastructure mostly due to potential disruptions from floodings, impacts to the construction season, and need for public transit or active transportation to curb emissions."
Warm Season , Tree Mgmt,0.9,"Changing climatic conditions affect which trees will survive, based on tolerance. "
Warm Season , Vulnerable Com,0.9,Vulnerable communities are particularly impacted by flooding because they are morelikely to live in floodplains. The poor segments of the population who lack air conditioning and rely on overnight temperature lows for cooling will no longer have low nighttime temperatures. Vulnerable populations have less resources to adapt to these changing conditions.
Warm Season , Water Quality,0.9,"Increased intensity of rainfall, more frequent 100-year storms, flashier flows all lead to negative impacts on phsyical, chemical, and biological water quality. "

Water Quality , Invasive Species,0.65,Degraded water quality might allow for generalist aquatic invasive species to thrive and outcompete sensitive native species. This has little effect on invasive terrestrial species.
Water Quality , Land Use,0.55,"Water quality issues, or even the presence of pristine water quality, might force people to be more or less conscious of how they affect waterways based on their land uses. "
Water Quality , Nutrients,0.55,"Motivation for improved water quality can lead to more efficient nutrient management and application strategies. Low oxygen events in water bodies (e.g. hypoxia) can cause the remineralization of phosphorus into the water column, feeding into nutrient cycling. This causes increased nutrient loading. "
Water Quality , Pests and Path,0.6,Poor water quality supports pests and pathogen spread. Pollutants and sewage can be a vector for pathogens. 
Water Quality , Recreation,0.75,Improved water quality and clean rivers (especially those that aren't on fire) improves recreational opportunitites.
